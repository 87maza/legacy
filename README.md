code challenge

Simple React app with 2 components and button functionality.

How run locally:
 git clone or download repo via zip

 Cmd Line:
``npm install``

Optional: Run
``gulp``

You should not receive error, if it does please email/message me your error.

 Open index.html via browser

I'm working on getting it on a node server and ultimately deployed on heroku/modulus.
Hope you like it!
